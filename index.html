<meta property="og:description" content="i hate cheater so much, i can no longer physically stand them anymore! everyday when i wake up, i am always reminded that i live in the same world as cheater. i have to walk on the same ground as cheater, breath the same air as cheater, do the same things as cheater, i cant anymore. its so tempting to rent out a rocket ship and fly my self to mars, just so i can be away from cheater. i cant stand cheater, i hate them so much! i once got contacted by a cheater via discord, i said to him "why cheat?". he proceeded to then leak all of my personal information which he found out via a fiverr hacker, and blackmailing my friends. i then said, "why leak?" which he then responded with a bunch of death threats and racial slurs, i hate cheater so much! i wish all cheater get ban, i wish all cheater go to hell! i wish all cheater are removed from this planet. without cheater, world peace would be a thing, but with cheater its not!" />
